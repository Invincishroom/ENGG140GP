# INFINIFLOW - ENGG1340 Group 99

This is a pipe rotation game based on the C++ language. Players need to adjust the direction of the pipes to make the water flow through the pipes and reach the target position. We represent ’S’ as the water source, ’T’ as the empty water tanks, and ‘X’ as the wall

## How to Start the Game

-Navigate to the "src" directory.
-Run the command "./main" to start the game.

## Game Rules

1. At the start of the game, the player will see a grid-like game interface, which includes some initial position pipe segments, a water source point, and target points, which is the empty tanks.

2. The player needs to rotate the direction of the pipe segments to make the water flow from the source point through the pipes and reach the target point.

3. The pipe segments can be rotated by pressing the keys, such as L, R keys or WASD keys.

4. When the water flow successfully reaches the empty tanks, the player wins.

5. Players are also able to select the difficult level of the game. There are Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. Each of the difficult levels are differentiated by the map size. In order to unlock the next difficult level, the game requires the basic completion of the previous difficulty level. 

## Control Keys
